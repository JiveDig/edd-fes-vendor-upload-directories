# Vendor Upload Directories #

An add-on for Easy Digital Downloads and Frontend Submissions that creates a separate directory in /uploads/edd/ for each vendors downloads and files.

By default, EDD and FES save all download files to /uploads/edd/.  This plugin automatically creates and upload directory per user.  If my user nicename in WordPress is 'MikeHemberger', Vendor Upload Directories will automatically put all my files in /uploads/edd/mikehemberger/

All you have to do is activate it and it just works.

## FAQS ##

### Can this plugin put all my existing files in the directories? ###

Unfortunatley, this plugin only works on all future uploads. To get you existing files in the new directories you have to go to each download and upload you file again. This will put it in the new vendor directory.
